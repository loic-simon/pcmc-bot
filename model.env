# .env: file containing text variables, considered by Python as environment
# variables thanks to dotenv.loadenv() and then accessible through os.getenv
# Here should be put:
#   - everything sensitive (acces tokens to different APIs, ...) ;
#   - every parameter that may change from a season to another (server ID, ...).

# EVERY VARIABLES WILL BE READ AS STRINGS, even if written without quote marks.
# Itegers/... stored here will need to be transformed after os.getenv call.
